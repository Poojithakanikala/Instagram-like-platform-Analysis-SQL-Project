# Instagram-Like platform analysis SQL Project

##Project Description

Welcome to the Instagram-like Platform Data Analysis Project! This project involves exploring and analyzing a simulated dataset from an Instagram-like platform called "ig_clone". Through a series of SQL queries, we will gain insights into user behaviors, engagement patterns, and content trends on the platform.

##Key Objectives:

User Longevity Recognition: We aim to recognize and reward the platform's longest-standing users. By identifying the five oldest users based on their registration dates, we acknowledge their loyalty and contribution to the platform.

Engagement Strategy: In order to optimize engagement strategies, we identify users who have never posted any photos. These users could be targeted in an email ad campaign to re-engage and encourage them to share content.

Contest Winner Determination: Through analyzing likes on photos, we will determine the user who won a contest for receiving the most likes on a photo. This showcases the importance of user engagement and content popularity.

Average User Post Frequency: By calculating the average number of posts per user, we offer insights into how often users typically share content, which can guide content strategies and user expectations.

Hashtag Insights: We help a brand identify the most frequently used hashtags by analyzing the tags associated with photos. This aids in selecting effective hashtags for their posts.

Bot Detection: Detecting potential bot activity is crucial for maintaining a healthy platform environment. By identifying users who have liked every single photo, we can flag potential bot accounts for further investigation.

Newest Joiners Spotlight: Recognizing the platform's newest members who joined in a specific month (May) allows us to highlight and welcome these users, fostering a sense of community.

Engaged and Multifaceted Users: By identifying users whose usernames start with 'c' and end with a number, and who have both posted photos and liked content, we pinpoint engaged and active users who contribute to the platform's ecosystem.

Top Content Contributors: Demonstrating the top 30 usernames that have posted photos within a specific range (3 to 5 posts) showcases the most active content contributors, potentially sparking collaboration opportunities.
